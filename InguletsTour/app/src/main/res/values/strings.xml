    <string name="lv_1_body">This town is by no means perfect, but I love the culture and the diversity. It’s corny and obvious, but polarizing at the same time. Especially in the climate we’re living in now, to have a city like this where you have so many different people from so many different backgrounds all contributing and making this thing work.</string>
    <string name="lv_2_header">About</string>
    <string name="lv_2_body">The city was founded in the 18th century by Zaporozhian Cossacks. Kryvyi Rih in Ukrainian literally means Crooked Horn. According to local legend, the city was founded by a crooked (Ukrainian slang for one-eyed) Cossack named Rih. However, records pre-dating the existence of the city refer to the area by the same name, due to the shape of the landmass formed by the merging of the river Saksahan into the Inhulets. Inhuletskyi District is an urban district of Kryvyi Rih City, southeastern-central Ukraine. Population: 58 000 (2013 population estimate). </string>
